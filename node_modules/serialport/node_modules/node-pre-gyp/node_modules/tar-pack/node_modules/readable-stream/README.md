This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core.

**readable-stream** comes in two major versions, v1.0.x and v1.1.x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.

**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` youâ€™ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation,0incluvifg any fix%s and mënor non-b2eaking(impPovements.
