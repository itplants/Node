 * A simple way to read and write simple ctypes. Of course, as you'll find the
 * code isn't as simple as it might appear. The following types are currently
 * supported in big and little endian formats:
 *
 * 	uint8_t			int8_t
 * 	uint16_t		int16_t
 * 	uint32_t		int32_t
 *	float (single precision IEEE 754)
 *	double (double precision IEEE 754)
 *
 * This is designed to work in Node and v8. It may in fact work in other
 * Javascript interpreters (that'd be pretty neat), but it hasn't been tested.
 * If you find that it does in fact work, that's pretty cool. Try and pass word
 * back to the original author.
 *
 * Note to the reader: If you're tabstop isn't set to 8, parts of this may look
 * weird.

/*
 * Numbers in Javascript have a secret: all numbers must be represented with an
 * IEEE-754 double. The double has a mantissa with a length of 52 bits with an
 * implicit one. Thus the range of integers that can be represented is limited
 * to the size of the mantissa, this makes reading and writing 64-bit integers
 * difficult, but far from impossible.
 *
 * Another side effect of this representation is what happens when you use the
 * bitwise operators, i.e. shift left, shift right, and, or, etc. In Javascript,
 * each operand and the result is cast to a signed 32-bit number. However, in
 * the case of >>> the values are cast to an unsigned number.

/*
 * Signed integer types, yay team! A reminder on how two's complement actually
 * works. The first bit is the signed bit, i.e. tells us whether or not the
 * number should be positive or negative. If the two's complement value is
 * positive, then we're done, as it's equivalent to the unsigned representation.
 *
 * Now if the number is positive, you're pretty much done, you can just leverage
 * the unsigned translations and return those. Unfortunately, negative numbers
 * aren't quite that straightforward.
 *
 * At first glance, one might be inclined to use the traditional formula to
 * translate binary numbers between the positive and negative values in two's
 * complement. (Though it doesn't quite work for the most negative value)
 * Mainly:
 *  - invert all the bits
 *  - add one to the result
 *
 * Of course, this doesn't quite work in Javascript. Take for example the value
 * of -128. This could be represented in 16 bits (big-endian) as 0xff80. But of
 * course, Javascript will do the following:
 *
 * > ~0xff80
 * -65409
 *
 * Whoh there, Javascript, that's not quite right. But wait, according to
 * Javascript that's perfectly correct. When Javascript ends up seeing the
 * constant 0xff80, it has no notion that it is actually a signed number. It
 * assumes that we've input the unsigned value 0xff80. Thus, when it does the
 * binary negation, it casts it into a signed value, (positive 0xff80). Then
 * when you perform binary negation on that, it turns it into a negative number.
 *
 * Instead, we're going to have to use the following general formula, that works
 * in a rather Javascript friendly way. I'm glad we don't support this kind of
 * weird numbering scheme in the kernel.
 *
 * (BIT-MAX - (unsigned)val + 1) * -1
 *
 * The astute observer, may think that this doesn't make sense for 8-bit numbers
 * (really it isn't necessary for them). However, when you get 16-bit numbers,
 * you do. Let's go back to our prior example and see how this will look:
 *
 * (0xffff - 0xff80 + 1) * -1
 * (0x007f + 1) * -1
 * (0x0080) * -1
 *
 * Doing it this way ends up allowing us to treat it appropriately in
 * Javascript. Sigh, that's really quite ugly for what should just be a few bit
 * shifts, ~ and &.

 * We now move onto IEEE 754: The traditional form for floating point numbers
 * and what is secretly hiding at the heart of everything in this. I really hope
 * that someone is actually using this, as otherwise, this effort is probably
 * going to be more wasted.
 *
 * One might be tempted to use parseFloat here, but that wouldn't work at all
 * for several reasons. Mostly due to the way floats actually work, and
 * parseFloat only actually works in base 10. I don't see base 10 anywhere near
 * this file.
 *
 * In this case we'll implement the single and double precision versions. The
 * quadruple precision, while probably useful, wouldn't really be accepted by
 * Javascript, so let's not even waste our time.
 *
 * So let's review how this format looks like. A single precision value is 32
 * bits and has three parts:
 *   -  Sign bit
 *   -  Exponent (Using bias notation)
 *   -  Mantissa
 *
 * |s|eeeeeeee|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
 * 31| 30-23  |  22    	-       0       |
 *
 * The exponent is stored in a biased input. The bias in this case 127.
 * Therefore, our exponent is equal to the 8-bit value - 127.
 *
 * By default, a number is normalized in IEEE, that means that the mantissa has
 * an implicit one that we don't see. So really the value stored is 1.m.
 * However, if the exponent is all zeros, then instead we have to shift
 * everything to the right one and there is no more implicit one.
 *
 * Special values:
 *  - Positive Infinity:
 *	Sign:		0
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *  - Negative Infinity:
 *	Sign:		1
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *  - NaN:
 *	Sign:		*
 *	Exponent: 	All 1s
 *	Mantissa:	non-zero
 *  - Zero:
 *	Sign:		*
 *	Exponent:	All 0s
 *	Mantissa:	0
 *
 * In the case of zero, the sign bit determines whether we get a positive or
 * negative zero. However, since Javascript cannot determine the difference
 * between the two: i.e. -0 == 0, we just always return 0.

/*
 * We now move onto our friends in the signed number category. Unlike unsigned
 * numbers, we're going to have to worry a bit more about how we put values into
 * arrays. Since we are only worrying about signed 32-bit values, we're in
 * slightly better shape. Unfortunately, we really can't do our favorite binary
 * & in this system. It really seems to do the wrong thing. For example:
 *
 * > -32 & 0xff
 * 224
 *
 * What's happening above is really: 0xe0 & 0xff = 0xe0. However, the results of
 * this aren't treated as a signed number. Ultimately a bad thing.
 *
 * What we're going to want to do is basically create the unsigned equivalent of
 * our representation and pass that off to the wuint* functions. To do that
 * we're going to do the following:
 *
 *  - if the value is positive
 *	we can pass it directly off to the equivalent wuint
 *  - if the value is negative
 *	we do the following computation:
 *	mb + val + 1, where
 *	mb	is the maximum unsigned value in that byte size
 *	val	is the Javascript negative integer
 *
 *
 * As a concrete value, take -128. In signed 16 bits this would be 0xff80. If
 * you do out the computations:
 *
 * 0xffff - 128 + 1
 * 0xffff - 127
 * 0xff80
 *
 * You can then encode this value as the signed version. This is really rather
 * hacky, but it should work and get the job done which is our goal here.
 *
 * Thus the overall flow is:
 *   -  Truncate the floating point part of the number
 *   -  We don't have to take the modulus, because the unsigned versions will
 *   	take care of that for us. And we don't have to worry about that
 *   	potentially causing bad things to happen because of sign extension
 *   -  Pass it off to the appropriate unsigned version, potentially modifying
 *	the negative portions as necessary.
